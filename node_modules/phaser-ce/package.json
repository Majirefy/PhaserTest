  "readme": "# Phaser CE (Community Edition) - HTML5 Game Framework\n\n<img src=\"http://phaser.io/images/github/arcade-cab.png\" align=\"right\">\n\nPhaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering, and supports desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native desktop apps via 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development. Years after release, Phaser is still one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.\n\nThousands of developers worldwide use Phaser. From indies and multi-national digital agencies, to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible [games](http://phaser.io/games/).\n\nPhaser v2 was originally built and maintained by the company [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com), but was turned over to the community in November 2016. [Phaser v3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/v3) is in active development.\n\n- **Visit:** The [Phaser website](http://phaser.io) and follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) (#[phaserjs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/phaserjs))\n- **Learn:** [API Docs](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/), [Support Forum][forum] and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phaser-framework)\n- **Code:** 700+ [Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) (source available in this [repo][examples])\n- **Read:** Weekly [Phaser World](#newsletter) Newsletter\n- **Chat:** [Slack](http://phaser.io/community/slack) and [Discord](http://phaser.io/community/discord)\n- **Extend:** With [Phaser Plugins](http://phaser.io/shop/plugins)\n- **Be awesome:** [Support](#support) the future of Phaser\n\nGrab the source and join in the fun!\n\n## Contents\n\n- [What's New?](#whats-new)\n- [Support Phaser](#support)\n- [Phaser World Newsletter](#newsletter)\n- [Download Phaser](#download)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Building Phaser](#building-phaser)\n- [Games made with Phaser](#games)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Change Log](#change-log)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n<a name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n## What's New\n\n### 23rd March 2017\n\n[Phaser CE](ttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) is the Community Edition of [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). In short, it's a version of Phaser that you, the community, have direct control over.\n\nIt was started with the 2.7.0 release and since then the community has worked to continue updating it, fixing bugs and adding new features.\n\nPhaser 2 was a massive milestone for us, and we're still constantly amazed at all the cool things you created, and continue to create with it. Thank you to everyone who has submitted an issue or pull request over the years, or helped the framework grow in any shape or capacity.\n\nAs of today all of our in-house resources are spent on building Phaser 3 and beyond. However we fully recognize that lots of you still use Phaser 2, and have a lot to contribute to its future. So this is what we've done:\n\n* Phaser 2.6.2 is the last 'official' release, published on npm as [phaser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser)\n* Phaser 2.7.0 and all future versions have been given to the community to maintain, published on npm as [phaser-ce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser-ce)\n\n**All Pull Requests made against this repo will be unconditionally approved**.\n\nWe'll give GitHub permissions to a select few individuals to help with this process if they request them. And when you, the community, request it, we will publish new versions to npm.\n\nWe believe this set-up will give us the best of both worlds. It will allow us to continue focusing our efforts on Phaser 3. And it will allow the community to enhance Phaser 2 for as long as they wish.\n\nAs always, check the [Change Log](#change-log) to see what was added recently.\n\nKeep your eyes on the web site, and subscribe to the weekly Phaser World [newsletter](#newsletter). You can also follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm), or chat in the Phaser [Slack](http://phaser.io/community/slack) and [Discord](http://phaser.io/community/discord) channels.\n\nThere are also now more ways than before to help [support](#support) the development of Phaser. The uptake so far has been fantastic, but this is an on-going mission. Thank you to everyone who supports our development. Who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phasers role in that.\n\nHappy coding everyone!\n\nCheers,\n\nRich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)\n\n![boogie](http://www.phaser.io/images/spacedancer.gif)\n\n<a name=\"support\"></a>\n## Support Phaser\n\nDeveloping Phaser takes a lot of time, effort, and money. There are monthly running costs; such as the forum and site, which we maintain 100% ad-free. As well as countless hours of development time, community support, and assistance resolving issues. We do this out of our love for Phaser of course, but at the end of the day there are real tangible costs involved.\n\nIf you have found Phaser useful in your development life. Or have made income as a result of using it, and are in a position to support us financially, without causing any detriment to yourself, then please do. There are a number of ways:\n\n* A monthly contribution via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm).\n* A [one-off donation](http://phaser.io/community/donate) via PayPal.\n* Purchase any of our [plugins or books](http://phaser.io/shop).\n* Companies can sponsor a release of Phaser, or an issue of our newsletter.\n\nIt all helps cover our running costs, and genuinely contributes towards future development.\n\nIf you would like to sponsor Phaser then please [get in touch](mailto:support@phaser.io). We have sponsorship options available on our GitHub repo, web site, and newsletter. All of which receive tens of thousands of eyeballs per day.\n\n<a name=\"newsletter\"></a>\n## Weekly Newsletter\n\nEvery Friday we publish the [Phaser World](http://phaser.io/community/newsletter) newsletter. It's packed full of the latest Phaser games, tutorials, videos, meet-ups, talks, and more. It also contains our weekly Development Progress updates. If you want to know what we're working on, this is the newsletter to read!\n\nPrevious editions can found on our [Back Issues](http://phaser.io/community/backissues) page.\n\n<a name=\"download\"></a>\n## Download Phaser\n\nPhaser is [hosted on Github][phaser]. There are a number of ways to download it:\n\n* Clone the git repository via [https][clone-http], [ssh][clone-ssh] or with the Github [Windows][clone-ghwin] or [Mac][clone-ghmac] clients.\n* Download as [zip][get-zip] or [tar.gz][get-tgz]\n* Download just the build files: [phaser.js][get-js] and [phaser.min.js][get-minjs]\n* Checkout with [svn][clone-svn]\n\n### Bower / npm\n\nInstall via [bower](http://bower.io)\n\n`bower install phaser`\n\nInstall via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)\n\n`npm install phaser-ce`\n\nUsing Browserify? Please [read this](#browserify).\n\n### CDN\n\n[jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!phaser) is a \"super-fast CDN for developers\". Include the following in your html:\n\n    <script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/phaser-ce/2.7.6/phaser.js\"></script>\n\nor the minified version:\n\n    <script src=\"//cdn.jsdelivr.net/phaser-ce/2.7.6/phaser.min.js\"></script>\n\n### Phaser Sandbox\n\nIf you'd like to try coding in Phaser right now, with nothing more than your web browser, then head over to the [Phaser Sandbox](http://phaser.io/sandbox). You'll find Quick Start templates, and a user-friendly editor filled with handy code-completion features.\n\n### License\n\nPhaser is released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n<a name=\"getting-started\"></a>\n## Getting Started\n\nOur [Getting Started Guide](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) will get you up to speed quickly. From setting up a web server, to picking an IDE. After which read our [Making your first Game](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) tutorial. Please work through this, no matter what your development experience, to learn how Phaser approaches things.\n\nThe single biggest Phaser resource is the [Phaser web site](http://phaser.io/news). You'll find hundreds of tutorials, with new ones added every week. Subscribe to the [Phaser World](http://phaser.io/community/newsletter) newsletter for a weekly links round-up.\n\nUsing **TypeScript**? [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx) has a great series of tutorials covering that.\n\nPrefer **videos**? Zenva have an excellent [Phaser video course](https://academy.zenva.com/product/the-complete-mobile-game-development-course-platinum-edition/?a=13), with hours of great material.\n\n### Source Code Examples\n\nEver since we started Phaser we've been growing and expanding our extensive set of examples. Currently there are over 700 of them, with the full source code and assets available.\n\nBrowse the [Phaser Examples](http://phaser.io/examples), or clone the [examples repo][examples], and eat your heart out!\n\n### Interphase\n\n[Interphase](http://phaser.io/interphase) is a programming book for Phaser developers of all skill levels.\n\nWith 400 pages of content you'll find detailed articles, game development \"Making Of\" guides and tutorials. All were written using the latest version of Phaser, so you won't be learning any out-dated tricks.\n\nAs well as the [book](http://phaser.io/interphase) you get all the source code, graphics and assets to go with it, and lots of extras too.\n\n### Phaser Editor - A complete Phaser Editor\n\n[Phaser Editor](http://phaser.io/shop/apps/phaser-editor) is a brand new Eclipse based editor that offers lots of built-in tools specifically for Phaser developers. Handy features include Smart code auto-completion, built-in web server, documentation search, asset management, texture atlas creator, audio sprite creator, asset previews and lots more.\n\n### Game Mechanic Explorer\n\nThe [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com) is a great interactive way to learn how to develop specific game mechanics in Phaser. Well worth exploring once you've got your dev environment set-up.\n\n### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor\n\n[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.\n\n<a name=\"building-phaser\"></a>\n## Building Phaser\n\nPhaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version for production. You can also create your own builds.\n\n### Custom Builds\n\nPhaser includes a grunt based build system, which allows you to strip out  features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be excluded too.\n\nAs a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.\n\nSee the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.\n\n<a name=\"browserify\"></a>\n### Browserify / CJS\n\nPhaser was never written to be modular. Everything exists under one single global namespace, and you cannot `require` selected parts of it into your builds. It expects 3 global vars to exist in order to work properly: `Phaser`, `PIXI` and `p2`. The following is one way of doing this:\n\n```\nwindow.PIXI = require('phaser/build/custom/pixi')\nwindow.p2 = require('phaser/build/custom/p2')\nwindow.Phaser = require('phaser/build/custom/phaser-split')\n```\n\nIf you build a custom version of Phaser it will split the 3 core libs out into their own files, allowing you to require them as above.\n\nWe appreciate this is just a band-aid, and not a proper use of modules, but please understand it was never built to be used this way. You're trying to fit a square peg in a round browserify-shaped hole, so compromises have to be made. Please don't open GitHub issues about it as we've no intention of changing Phaser at this stage of its life. Full module based development is available in Phaser v3.\n\n### Webpack\n\nStarting from Phaser 2.4.5 we now include a custom build for Webpack.\n\nYou need to add `p2` as a dependency.\n\nSee [lean/phaser-es6-webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack) for a sample configuration.\n\n### Building from source\n\nShould you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.\n\nRun `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.\n\n### Packaging a new release\n\nReleases of new versions of Phaser CE are under the communities control. If you feel there are sufficient fixes, or important ones that warrant a new version release, then please do the following:\n\n1. Make sure the version number is increased, in line with semver policies, in the following files: `package.json` and `src/Phaser.js`\n\n2. Make sure that you have added details of the new version to the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. This should include a summary of changes made in the version. You can usually obtain this from the commit / PR history. It's nice to credit who made the changes by linking to their GitHub user ID, but isn't a requirement.\n\n3. From the root repo folder, run `grunt jshint` and make sure there are no jshint errors. If there are, please fix them, or request that the original author of the code does so.\n\n4. Once jshint passes run `grunt release`, sit back, and wait. It will build all of the versions of Phaser required, update the doc files, TypeScript defs and lots more. When finished, commit all of the new files and make sure to include a clear message in your commit saying you want this release pushed to npm. Be sure to tag me when doing this, i.e. 'Phaser CE Version 2.X.X. Please publish to npm @photonstorm' - I'll see it, and then publish as soon as I can (often the same day).\n\n<a name=\"games\"></a>\n## Made With Phaser\n\nThousands of [games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) have been made in Phaser. From game jam entries, to titles by some of the largest entertainment brands in the world. You can find [hundreds more on our web site](http://phaser.io/games).\n\nWe add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!\n\n<a name=\"requirements\"></a>\n## Requirements\n\nPhaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.\n\nWhile Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.\n\n### IE9\n\nIf you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x _and_ use P2 physics, then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.\n\n### JavaScript and TypeScript\n\nPhaser is developed in ES5 JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code, and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't _force_ you to. It's your choice.\n\nIf you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.\n\n<a name=\"change-log\"></a>\n# Change Log\n\n## Version 2.7.6 - 13th April 2017\n\n### New Features\n\n* New method [Phaser.Loader#imageFromBitmapData](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Loader.html#imageFromBitmapData) lets you preload an image extracted from a BitmapData canvas.\n* [BitmapData#generateTexture](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.BitmapData.html#generateTexture) now has an optional callback argument. Most browsers now load the generated image asynchronously, so without a callback you're not guaranteed a valid texture (#136).\n* [Phaser.GameObjectFactory#weapon](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.GameObjectFactory.html#weapon) (used as `game.add.weapon`) now has a `bulletClass` argument. Without this it was difficult to set `bulletClass` before creating the bullet pool.\n\n### Updates\n\n* [Phaser.Cache#addImage](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Cache.html#addImage) now emits a warning if you add an image that hasn't completed loading.\n* [Phaser.Frame](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Frame.html) now emits a warning if a Frame is constructed with a zero width or height.\n* [Phaser.Physics.Arcade#velocityFromAngle](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.html#velocityFromAngle) now uses [Phaser.Math](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Math.html) instead of `game.math`, so you can use it without a reference to a running game (#131).\n* Clarified [Emitter#start](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter.html#start) documentation. It's really easier to use [Emitter#explode](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter.html#explode) or [Emitter#flow](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter.html#flow).\n* The game canvas's [cursor style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) is now `pointer` when the cursor is over an object with `input.useHandCursor` enabled and empty at all other times. This should make it easier to set your own cursor style for the game (#110).\n* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (#75, #101, #107)\n* Docs typo fixes (#101)\n* Added [photonstorm/phaser-plugins](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins) to the Phaser CE docs: see [Phaser.Plugin](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Plugin.html) (#107)\n* BitmapData and RenderTexture objects are now destroyed when clearing the cache (#68). This should reduce memory use.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fixed an issue where a display object's preUpdate call would be skipped if a sibling was removed or destroyed, which could create small discrepancies in position, lifespan, or renderOrderID (#103).\n* Fixed an issue where display objects using the default texture could have an incorrect size (1×1) and appear blank (#138). The built-in DEFAULT and MISSING textures are now loaded asynchronously to ensure that they're valid.\n* Fixed an issue where [game.device.canUseMultiply](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Device.html#canUseMultiply) could hold a false negative on first (Firefox, Safari) or even subsequent (Chrome 57) page loads, disabling most blend modes when using the Canvas renderer (#130).\n* [Phaser.Keyboard#lastChar](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Keyboard.html#lastChar) is now `null` if Phaser has recorded no key presses yet. Reading it before a key press no longer raises an error (#132).\n* Previously, the `center` of a moving Arcade Physics Body was inaccurate during the game's update phase, and that made collision checks of circular Bodies less accurate (#122). This was fixed by updating `center` during preUpdate.\n* Fixed an issue when dragging a sprite whose parent is scaled or rotated (#108). Now the sprite follows the cursor correctly.\n* Fixed audio skipping when restarting playback (#78)\n* Fixed bad rendering of multiple tinted BitmapText objects (#58)\n* Fixed Object.assign not existing on older devices (#81)\n* Previously, the HEADLESS renderer essentially became a CANVAS renderer after boot, which was incorrect (#74). Phaser.HEADLESS now sets up a PIXI.CanvasRenderer and a detached (invisible) canvas. It skips `render` hooks but not the `preRender` and `postRender` hooks (strange). [game.renderType](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/Phaser.Game.html#renderType) now contains either Phaser.CANVAS, Phaser.HEADLESS, or Phaser.WEBGL after boot.\n\n### Thanks\n\n@alexus85, @Arcanorum, @digitsensitive, @Dreaded-Gnu, @hdodov, @IVA-apps, @JTronLabs, @Lightning3105, @mikewesthad, @nalgorry, @photonstorm, @qarlosh, @samme, @trpzn, @vpmedia\n\nFor changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n# Contributing\n\nThe [Contributors Guide][contribute] contains full details on how to help with Phaser development.
